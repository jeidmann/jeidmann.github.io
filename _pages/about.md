Hello! I am a `Senior Data Scientist` at ChampionX Emission technologies, primarily working on the SOOFIE continuous monitoring system. As a `geoscientist`, I learned to look at challenges from different angles...quite literally, but also in terms of short- and long time scales. At ChampionX I am applying my creative problem-solving skills with my background of particle transport, and am applying it to the movement of methane particles in the atmosphere. I embrace the `growth mindset` and am always looking to build upon and learn new skills! 

During my M.S. and Ph.D., I gained experience conducting data analysis on large and disparate data sets. It was through a diverse breadth of projects that I became adept in `data analysis`, `statistical analysis`, `remote sensing`, and `data visualization`. Please visit the [<b><u>Projects</u></b>](/projects/) page to find out more about the things that I have worked on.
<h4> Background </h4>
I was born in Germany and grew up in the Boston area. I grew up running cross country and road races (since the 3rd grade) and played the viola in the Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra. 

I spent my college years exploring the geology of the Berkshires at `Williams College` in Western Massachusetts. However, I also managed to explore Geology across the world, taking part in a field course that traveled across the United States (a camping roadtrip from Pennsylvania to Montana), studying abroad at `ETH Zurich` in Switzerland, and performing undergrad thesis research in Svalbard, Norway (funded through the NSF/REU and Keck Consortium).

In the years after college, I worked at `Geosyntec Consultants`--an environmental consulting firm-- working to remediate contaminated land. Projects brought me to New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Vermont, and Maine. One particular project along the Penobscot River in Bangor Maine insighted an interest in sediment transport and modeling that I chose to pursue.

In 2016 I moved to Fort Collins to pursue my `M.S.` degree at Colorado State University. During my degree, I worked alongside the City of Longmont to better inform them of the post-flood sediment dynamics of their drinking water reservoir. My research allowed them to understand how snowmelt affected sediment input to the reservoir, and how reservoir management activities impacted this sediment remobilization within the reservoir.

Throughout my `Ph.D.` research I sought to enhance my coding and analytical skills of large data sets. For my research I traveled to Puerto Rico, initially with the goal of better predicting hurricane-induced landsliding. As the COVID-19 pandemic hit, however, the ability to do fieldwork became quite limited. This led me to take a step back and look at the bigger picture of landscape dynamics in Puerto Rico. As a result, I dove into analysis of `remote sensing` imagery to extract channel measurements (in particular bedrock river width) to better understand landscape-scale differences in the rivers that shape the landscape. Through this research I `developed my own new method` of channel width extraction, automating the extraction process through creating a routine (comprised of coding, data visualization, and a series of functions or subroutines), and explained the process through a comprehensive User Manual. Having developed this process, I then extracted the channel width at 1-meter resolution from >10,000 locations across the entire island of Puerto Rico (3,500 square miles)!

In 2023 I joined `ChampionX Emissions Technologies` (formally Scientific Aviation) as a `Data Scientist`, and now stepping into the role of a `Senior Data Scientist`. Since joining the team, we have worked hard to expand on the use of the SOOFIE sensors, which are used in oil & gas, landfill, and abandoned well applications to effectively and efficiently detect methane leaks so that we can address any fugitive emissions and limit society's methane emissions to the atmosphere. With every leak we detect, we are one step closer to reducing our greenhouse gas footprint.

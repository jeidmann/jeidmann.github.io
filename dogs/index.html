He had matted fur, was very scared, and overwhelmed. He had clearly never lived in a home before, as he was shocked by TVs, jumped on counters, and did not know to go outside to potty. In the few weeks we had him, he made huge strides and learned how to build confidence and be a dog. </div> <div class="dog-status"> <button class="status-btn adopted"> adopted </button> </div> </div> </div> <div class="dog-entry"> <img class="dog-image" src="/assets/img/Wilbur.jpg" alt="9.

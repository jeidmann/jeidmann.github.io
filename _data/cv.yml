    - title: Data Scientist
      institution: ChampionX Emission Technologies, Boulder, Colorado
      year: 2023-2024
      description:
        - Developed a source localization algorithm that integrates sensor and environmental data to help clients visualize the most likely source of alerts and leaks.
        - Created a sensor placement algorithm that allows the client to interactively input site information (e.g. perimeter, roads, buildings, source locations), automatically extract wind data from proprietary and public sources, to present an optimized placement scheme that not only provides recommended placement locations, but allows for the client to choose the ideal number of sensors to meet their detection needs.
        - Working to develop an improved plume model for quantification of methane emissions.
        - Regularly assist the sales and customer service team to meet client needs and provide technical support.
        - Conducted research comparing the accuracy and quality of data associated with different wind sensors.
    - title: Ph.D. and M.S. Researcher
      institution: Colorado State University, Geology Department, Fort Collins, Colorado
      year: 2016-2022
      description:
        - Developed a novel method (>600 lines of code) using LiDAR and flood scenarios to model bedrock channel geometry at a large scale/frequency, under equal flow conditions; improved industry flood prediction and landscape evolution models (method results >95% accuracy, USGS data verified)
        - Collaborated with the City of Longmont on a ~$80K project to improve reservoir management and limit water storage loss by integrating instrument measurements, computer models, and statistical analyses to predict channel response & reservoir delta evolution after an extreme flood
        - Assessed the impact of pre-emptive forest treatment on wildfire intensity and vegetation recovery using Google Earth Engine to perform spatial and time series analyses (>10 years)
        - Conducted a “big data” assessment by combining monthly NDVI imagery to automate yearly change detection analyses across a landscape scale (100s to 1,000 mi2) using Python3 with ArcGIS (ArcPy)
        - Secured over $92K in research funding from 16 fellowships and scholarships
    - title: Graduate Teaching Assistant and Student Mentor
      institution: Colorado State University, Geology Department, Fort Collins, Colorado
      year: 2016-2022
      description:
        - Taught over 360 students in 11 laboratory sections within the Geosciences department; courses taught included Introductory Geology for Majors, Geomorphology, and Earth History
        - Mentored 4 senior-level undergraduates in their independent studies and post-college plans
    - title: Geosciences Modeling/ Remote Sensing Intern
      institution: ConocoPhillips, Houston, Texas
      year: May - August 2021
      description:
        - Built a satellite remote sensing-based workflow to improve predictions of the location and timing of landslides to mitigate further damages to a pipeline that had suffered significant financial losses. This method merged the use of remote imagery with Principal Components Analysis and Machine Learning techniques to better understand and predict pipeline hazards
    - title: Senior Engineering Technician II
      institution: Geosyntec Consultants, Acton, Massachusetts
      year: 2014-2016
      description:
        - Led groundwater monitoring, soil logging, soil sampling, sub-slab sampling, well installation, & in-situ bioremediation fieldwork at 12 Superfund and Brownfields sites across 7 states
        - Analyzed soil mercury data using statistical models to produce a recommended sampling approach, and authored a memorandum for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection communicating and synthesizing the approach

      description:
        - As a professional development opportunity to stay updated with the latest strides in methane emission mitigation, I took part in the course 'SYSE 580A8- Modeling Methane Emissions from Oil and Gas', taught by the Methane Emissions Technology Evaluation Center (METEC) faculty. This course took a deep dive into Monte Carlo methods and mechanistic models employed today to estimate annual methane emissions at an oil and gas facility.

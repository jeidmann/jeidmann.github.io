He had clearly never lived in a home before, as he was shocked by TVs, jumped on counters, and did not know to go outside to potty. In the few weeks we had him, he made huge strides and learned how to build confidence and be a dog. "

During treatment it was determined that Betty had become pregnant during her transport to the rescue, but it was later determined that the heartworm treatment aborted the pregnancy.
